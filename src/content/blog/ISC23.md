Congratulations! üéâüéâ 

The student team from National Tsing Hua University's Computer Science department has achieved an impressive feat by securing second place at the ISC (International Supercomputing Conference) European Student Cluster Competition.

From May 21st to 25th, our team traveled to Hamburg, Germany, to participate in the prestigious ISC, which serves as a platform for universities worldwide to showcase their comprehensive hardware and software capabilities. Among 70 competing teams, we stood out during the initial stage, earning a spot in the finals. Competing against seven renowned institutions, we are thrilled to announce our remarkable second-place finish! ü•à

The ISC competition in Germany, alongside SCC in the United States and ASC in China, is recognized as one of the world's top three supercomputing events, offering students a chance to demonstrate their skills in a challenging environment. This year, we had the privilege to compete against formidable teams from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, ETH Zurich in Switzerland, and the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom.

Over the course of three days, our team faced various tasks, including quantum computing, fluid simulation, and stellar magnetic fields. The competition also presented a secret challenge for us to solve. With six months of dedicated preparation and unwavering determination, our NTHU students showcased their expertise and impressed the judges with their outstanding performance.

Beyond the competitive aspect, our NTHU team actively engaged in knowledge sharing and cultural exchange with fellow participants from different countries. We were delighted to represent Taiwan and promote our rich cultural heritage. It was particularly amusing to see our team fostering goodwill by bringing a box of Taiwanese snacks to share with others. üòÜ

NTHU has a strong track record in supercomputing competitions, having previously secured the overall championship at the SCC (Student Cluster Competition) World Supercomputer Competition in the United States. Additionally, we have emerged as champions in the China ASC (Advanced Supercomputing) World University Student Supercomputer Competition in both 2019 and 2021.

This year's achievement marks our inaugural success at ISC in Germany after three years of participation, adding another prestigious accolade to NTHU's impressive collection. We are immensely proud of our team's accomplishments! üëçüëç

We extend our heartfelt appreciation to our sponsors, Yun Da Technologies, Quanta Computer, and the National Center for High-Performance Computing, for their unwavering support of our NTHU Computer Science student team.
