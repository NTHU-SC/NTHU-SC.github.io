The National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) team’s outstanding performance in the OpenCAEPoro challenge at the ASC24 competition earned them the prestigious E Prize. This year’s ASC competition, spanning nearly six months, attracted over 300 university teams worldwide. After rigorous pre-selection, 25 teams advanced to the finals at Shanghai University, marking a record high in participation. The finals demanded that teams design and optimize a small-scale supercomputing cluster under a 3000W power constraint, tackling cutting-edge scientific and engineering applications such as HPL & HPCG benchmarks, large model inference optimization, fluid simulation, and Mars atmospheric simulation.

In the challenging fluid simulation task, the NTHU team fully utilized cluster computing resources to complete large-scale parallel optimizations under strict power constraints. They achieved the best performance by completing all test cases in the shortest runtime, securing the E Prize for computational excellence.

Throughout the competition, the NTHU team faced various unexpected obstacles. From logistical challenges like receiving their GPUs only on the first afternoon of the competition to dealing with unfamiliar environments, they demonstrated remarkable adaptability. The finals were particularly demanding, as the team encountered difficulties with GPU installation. Despite these setbacks, they maintained their focus and successfully resolved the issues, showcasing their technical expertise under pressure.

Beyond the technical aspects, the NTHU team embraced cultural exchange opportunities at the competition. They shared Hsinchu’s iconic "kuaikuai" snacks with other teams, symbolizing their hope for smooth-running machines. This gesture of goodwill led to exchanges of small gifts with teams from Peking University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and others, fostering a spirit of camaraderie among competitors. The team also engaged in valuable technical discussions, learning from other participants and sharing their insights.

The NTHU team’s success in winning the E Prize was not just a reflection of their technical skills but also of their collaborative spirit. They benefited from the guidance of their mentors and the support of the competition organizers, which allowed them to focus on the tasks at hand. The ASC journey was both challenging and enriching, leaving the team with not only a prestigious award but also a deeper connection to the global supercomputing community.
