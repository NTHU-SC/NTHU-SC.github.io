Our student team from National TsingHua University's Computer Science department have secured the champion of 6th APAC HPC-AI student competition again, with a third place also taken done by us!

The competition has been for six month long with fully onsite access with NCI Australia and NSCC Singapore cluster. Totally 24 teams from 12 different countries have participated in HPC-AI, MPAS-Atmosphere was this year's HPC task, a collaborative project for developing atmosphere, ocean and other earth-system simulation components for use in climate, regional climate and weather studies; the AI task was BLOOM, a Large Language Model (LLM) with its 176 billion parameters. By the time we dedicated in these tasks, eventually we performed excellent final result and may proundly confirm we have also done a insanely great job in our presentation, really appreciate all the support and time spending from our advisor and all the coaches!

HPC-AI's mainly goat simply was sped up these two tasks, while the tasks were kind of weird in this year. We haven't achieve a big amount of speed up like last year's experience, the confusion push us to come up with some innovative idea, at the end of the day, we have learn a lot than we excepted in HPC-AI. Otherwise, the new members we recruited this year were not only from CS major, thanks for advisor Chou's training camp, he decided to let the student from diverse departments have a chance to absorb knowledge in HPC. In the other hand, professor Chou has been dedicated for this team for years, we have gotten lots of resources from predecessors, coaches and professor homself. The repeated winner is definitely not by luck.

\\ too be fix and add more...
